### Hello FFXIV Anglers! Thanks for taking interest in this project and considering contributing to it. Feel free to make an issue or even a pull request! It's the community that drives this forward and inspires me.

### Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests. We're all here out of our passion for FFXIV and fishing, so let's give each other the benefit of the doubt.

### If you're not sure where to start, documentation can always use work! You can also visit the issue board to see what people are requesting.

### Please read the existing issues before creating another one. If you're ready to make a pull request (PR), check to make sure what your PR covers isn't already covered by another PR, and that your PR isn't too encompassing.

## Responsibilities
## * Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted, mainly iOS and Android for now.
## * Ensure that code you're commiting is commented and clean. We're aiming for functional programming here.
## * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.

## * Keep your pull requests as small as possible. The less code there is to review, the faster it can get merged in. Break features into multiple PRs.
## * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).


### Working on your first pull request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).


## To contribute code
## 1. Create your own fork of the code
## 2. Do the changes in your fork
## 3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Make sure your code is commented and easy to read.
    * Attribute any 3rd parties as necessary.
    * Create your pull request to the appropriate place.
## 4. Create a PR from your branch to the repo's `dev` branch

## 5. Address PR comments, if any, and then your branch should be ready to be merged!
